# osd-network-verifier

A cli tool and set of libraries that
verify the pre-configured networking components
for ROSA and OSD CCS clusters.

## Overview

osd-network-verifier can be used prior to or after the installation
of osd/rosa clusters to ensure the network configuration
is correctly set up per OSD requirements listed on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.html#installation-custom-aws-vpc-requirements_installing-aws-vpc

It currently verifies:
- Egress from VPC subnets to [essential OSD domains](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.html#osd-aws-privatelink-firewall-prerequisites_prerequisites)
- DNS resolution in a [VPC](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.html)

The recommended workflow of diagnostic use of ONV is shown in the following flow diagram:

### Building
`make build`: Builds `osd-network-verifier` executable in base directory

## Terraform Scripts (AWS)

The Terraform scripts in this repository allow you to set up a secure and scalable network infrastructure in AWS for testing. It will create a VPC with public, private, and firewall(optinal) subnets, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, and a network firewall(optinal).

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the Terraform scripts directory: `examples/aws/terraform`.
3. Copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars` and replace the placeholder values with your actual values.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.
5. Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.

See the Terraform `README.md` for detailed instructions.

## Contributing and Maintenance
If interested, please fork this repo and create pull requests to the `main` branch.

### Golden AMI
osd-network-verifier depends on these publicly available [AMIs](pkg/verifier/aws/aws_verifier.go#L24-L45) built from the [osd-network-verifier-golden-ami](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/osd-network-verifier-golden-ami) repo.

Golden AMI provides the following:
- runtime environment setup (such as container engine, configurations, etc.)
- building and embedding the validator binary which performs the individual checks to the endpoints

### Egress Lists

This lists of essential domains for egress verification should be maintained in the [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/osd-network-verifier-golden-ami/-/blob/master/build/config/). Newly-added lists should be registered as "platform types" in [`helpers.go`](pkg/helpers/helpers.go#L94) using the list file's extensionless name as the value (e.g., abc.yaml should be registered as `PlatformABC     string = "abc"`). Finally, the `--platform` help message and value handling logic in [`cmd.go`](cmd/egress/cmd.go) should also be updated.

### IAM Permission Requirement List

Version ID [required for IAM support role](docs/aws/aws.md#iam-support-role) may need update to match specification in [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_version.html).
