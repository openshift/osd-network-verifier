# osd-network-verifier

A cli tool and set of libraries that 
verify the pre-configured networking components
for ROSA and OSD CCS clusters.

## Overview

osd-network-verifier can be used prior to or after the installation 
of osd/rosa clusters to ensure the network configuration 
is correctly set up per OSD requirements listed on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.html#installation-custom-aws-vpc-requirements_installing-aws-vpc

It currently verifies:
- Egress from VPC subnets to essential OSD domains
- BYOVPC config requirements


The recommended workflow of diagnostic use of ONV is shown in the following flow diagram:

## Makefile Targets
ONV uses openshift/boilerplate https://github.com/openshift/boilerplate

Some useful targets
- `make build`: Builds `osd-network-verifier` executable in base directory
- `make osd-container-image-build` : Build the default container at build/Dockerfile and tag it based on the commit. Specify DOCKERFILE and IMAGE_URI to build other containers.
- `make osd-container-image-push` : Push the default container. 
  - To run locally, `make REGISTRY_USER=<quay-username> REGISTRY_TOKEN=<quay-token>  osd-container-image-build-push`
