# osd-network-verifier

A cli tool and set of libraries that 
verify the pre-configured networking components
for ROSA and OSD CCS clusters.

## Overview

osd-network-verifier can be used prior to or after the installation 
of osd/rosa clusters to ensure the network configuration 
is correctly set up per OSD requirements listed on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.html#installation-custom-aws-vpc-requirements_installing-aws-vpc

It currently verifies:
- Egress from VPC subnets to essential OSD domains
- BYOVPC config requirements
